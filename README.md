# Coffee Machine API

# problem statment
Build a REST API with endpoints that return the JSON data for the coffee machines and coffee pods screens. 
These endpoints should be filterable by product type, water line, coffee flavor, and pack size,
depending on whether the product is a coffee machine or coffee pod. For example, when filtering for large coffee machines,
the endpoint should return an array with CM101, CM102, and CM103 as JSON objects
